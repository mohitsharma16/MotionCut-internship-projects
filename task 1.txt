we have taken a variable score and initialized it to 0.
then we have taken name as a variable so that the user can enter hie/her name and the game starts
the ideology of this quiz game is very simple 
we have made a function quiz and we can call that function n times using our condition.
we have written a certain set of 5 questions and to answer those questions we have given 4 options;
using if else condition the program deccides whether the answer is correct or worng;
if correct then the answer is printed and some message is displayed ;
if wrong answer then correct answer is prompted and next question is displayed;
also as we ive correct answers the score gets on adding and if wrong answer the score remains as it was 
till the previous question.
also if the user wants to play the quiz game again they can do it.
we have also included this functionality to play again.
